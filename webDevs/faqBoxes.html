            <h3 class="faq-title">Tell Me a Bit About Yourself.</h3>
            <p class="faq-text">My name is Matt Mead. I'm from a small town in central Minnesota and graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in Art and Mass Communications. After college I, like most people, attempted to figure out what I actually wanted to do. This brought me to jobs such as teaching English as a second language, working in the service industry, becoming a High Level Cisco Engineer, Customer Service Representative, Production Coordinator, Operations Manager and eventually the owner of my own media company. When the pandemic hit, I realized with every job I've had, solving problems was at the forefront. And Because every solution to a problem needs good data behind it and a clear vision of how to solve it, I decided to go back to school for Data Analytics and Visualization at my Alma Mater. I am now persuing a career in Data Analytics and Full Stack Development.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-title">Why Should We Hire You?</h3>
            <p class="faq-text">I'm a curious and driven individual who has an extreme passion for learning new things and connecting them back to past experiences. I'm a creative thinker and hard worker who just wants to make the world a better place.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-title">What Do You Consider To Be Your Weaknesses?</h3>
            <p class="faq-text">"I care too much!" - just kidding. <br><br><em>I do care, a lot!</em> But a job is a job - and unless your doing something like trying to cure Cancer - most jobs are about making that paper. <br><br>Honestly, my biggest weakness is that I like to be involved in <em>everything</em> and have a hard time relinquishing control over tasks that impact the project as a whole.</p>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3 class="faq-title">Why Are There Gaps In Your Employment?</h3>
            <p class="faq-text">Because I wanted to see the world! Early on in my life I saw a bridge collapse into a river and it changed me. You can't be guaranteed a tomorrow - and as most grandparents will say, "Travel while you still can!". Yes, it may have put a damper on my resume. Apparently 'Gaps' aren't good? But damn, I've seen some cool things and I don't regret it for a second.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-title">Can You Explain Why You Changed Career Paths?</h3>
            <p class="faq-text">I think photojournalism and Data Analytics are pretty similar. You're gathering data and trying to visualize it the best you can to convey the facts in a way others will understand. After almost a decade of being a photographer, I just realized that being an Analyst is a bit more stable. And who are we kidding - stability is pretty sweet.</p>
